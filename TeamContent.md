<b> <u>GRID:<u></b>

<b>Boot strap grid : <b>
	 The Bootstrap grid system is a fundamental feature for creating responsive layouts. It uses rows and columns to divide webpages into sections and arrange content in a grid-like structure. Columns automatically adjust their width based on screen size, making the layout responsive and adaptable to different devices.

</b>Bootstrap grid system :</b>
	The Bootstrap Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can use all 12 columns individually or you can groups the columns together to create wider columns.
